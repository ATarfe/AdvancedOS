Answers:

I. The program does generate junk values. This is because of the race condition between the two processes, wherein each process tries to
   increment the value of global variable 'n' simultaneously. One process increments the variable and loads it into the register, but at 
   that moment, the OS switches to the other process and increments the variable, loads it into the register and stores the value. Now, 
   it resumes the first process, but the value is now reset.The OS now overwrites this value that the second process incremented.
   
II. No, All the values that are being produced are not getting consumed.
