1. What can you do about mixed input during debugging?
->  The mixed input can be the parameters defined by the user and also, multiple threads producing or
	consuming the input simultanoeusly. With the help of playing with the parameters such as increasing 
	or decreasing the number of streams or the time window, we can identify any faults in the flow of 
	the code.

2. Where do you need mutexes?
->	Mutexes are Mutual Exclusion Semaphores which are used to protect shared resources. In our case,
	during continuous consumption, we can use the mutexes before each consumer stream produced, for the 
	producer to properly synchronise the process.
